# MancalaProject
Hello and thank you for checking out my Mancala Java Applet.
The app was made with a two player feature and a single player vs AI feature

The AI algorithm that I used was a simple minimax recursive algorithm that I learned from studying other peoples minimax Tic Tac Toe, algorithms. My original inspiration for making this game was seeing other peoples algorithms that played games such as Tic Tac Toe and chess.

Right now I am working on making a simulation mode, with different AI algorithms to see which ones preform the best. I am also working on a better front end however I am more interested in working with the minimax.
